The project uses commitizen with cz-git for commit messages.
- Use conventional commit format: type(scope): subject
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert
- Scope is optional and should be the affected component or module
- Subject should be in present tense and not capitalized
- Use emoji in commit messages as configured
